# SQL Query Errors: NULL Values and Implicit Type Conversion

This repository demonstrates two common SQL errors:

1. **Improper NULL value handling:**  The `SUM()` function in SQL ignores NULL values, leading to inaccurate results when dealing with aggregated data.
2. **Implicit Type Conversion Errors:** Comparing columns of different data types without explicit type casting can lead to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.sql` file contains a flawed SQL query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  Read the detailed explanation in the bug report for deeper understanding.
